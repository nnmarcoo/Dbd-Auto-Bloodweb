# Dbd-Auto-Perks
Automatically upgrade the bloodweb in Dead by Daylight **(survivor only)**
## About
This is a simple solution that cuts some corners and uses rudimentary concepts to be as fast as I could get it. \
It was initially faster and more simple, it would select nodes at random, but this resulted in the loss of desired nodes. \
Some inspiration was taken from [IIInitiationnn](https://github.com/IIInitiationnn)'s fantastic [Blood Emporium](https://github.com/IIInitiationnn/BloodEmporium) project, be sure to check it out.
## Configuration
 - Toggling an item, addon, or offering on/off is done with the checkbox beside the icon.
 - Preferences are automatically saved.
 - Requires 16:9 monitor aspect ratio.
 ## Usage
 - You must be on the bloodweb tab in DBD before pressing start.
 - To stop, simply interrupt with by moving the mouse.
 - Everything is currently automatic except prestiging the bloodweb.
## todo
